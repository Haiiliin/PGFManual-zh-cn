\noindent
\emph{Graph drawing algorithms} do the tough work of computing a layout of a
graph for you. \tikzname\ comes with powerful such algorithms, but you can also
implement new algorithms in the Lua programming language. \vskip1cm

\begin{codeexample}[
    graphic=white,
    preamble={\usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta,graphs,graphdrawing}
\usegdlibrary{layered}}]
\tikz [nodes={text height=.7em, text depth=.2em,
              draw=black!20, thick, fill=white, font=\footnotesize},
       >={Stealth[round,sep]}, rounded corners, semithick]
  \graph [layered layout, level distance=1cm, sibling sep=.5em, sibling distance=1cm] {
    "5th Edition" -> { "6th Edition", "PWB 1.0" };
    "6th Edition" -> { "LSX" [>child anchor=45],  "1 BSD", "Mini Unix", "Wollongong", "Interdata" };
    "Interdata" -> { "Unix/TS 3.0", "PWB 2.0", "7th Edition" };
    "7th Edition" -> { "8th Edition", "32V", "V7M", "Ultrix-11", "Xenix", "UniPlus+" };
    "V7M" -> "Ultrix-11";
    "8th Edition" -> "9th Edition";
    "1 BSD" -> "2 BSD" -> "2.8 BSD" -> { "Ultrix-11", "2.9 BSD" };
    "32V" -> "3 BSD" -> "4 BSD" -> "4.1 BSD" -> { "4.2 BSD", "2.8 BSD", "8th Edition" };
    "4.2 BSD" -> { "4.3 BSD", "Ultrix-32" };
    "PWB 1.0" -> { "PWB 1.2" -> "PWB 2.0", "USG 1.0" -> { "CB Unix 1", "USG 2.0" }};
    "CB Unix 1" -> "CB Unix 2" -> "CB Unix 3" -> { "Unix/TS++", "PDP-11 Sys V" };
    { "USG 2.0" -> "USG 3.0", "PWB 2.0", "Unix/TS 1.0" } -> "Unix/TS 3.0";
    { "Unix/TS++", "CB Unix 3", "Unix/TS 3.0" } -> "TS 4.0" -> "System V.0" -> "System V.2" -> "System V.3";
  };

    You need to use Lua\TeX\ to typeset this part of the manual (and, also, to
    use algorithmic graph drawing).
